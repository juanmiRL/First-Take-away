# First-Take-away

In this Shiny app you will be able to perform a classification of diabetes. For this, two classification models are trained, such as Random Forest and logistic regression.

## Data Description 

In this section you will be able to visualize a table of the data, a summary and statistical tables of the quantitative variables. These tables change depending on the transformations performed in the following sections.

## Preprocess

In this section you can carry out pre-processing of the data. It can impute missing data (in the case that there is not, it can generate missing data randomly), as well as transform the data class of each variable.

## Dynamic Plots 

In this section you will be able to visualize univariate and bivariate dynamic graphs by selecting the variables you want, as well as the type of graph and other options such as changing the color.

## Classification models 

In this section you will be able to view the confusion matrices of the results of training and testing the Random Forest and Logistic Regression models, as well as seeing the importance of each variable for each model.

## Prediction

In this section you can make a prediction of the class (diabetes or non-diabetes) of a new person by choosing new values for each of the variables involved.
